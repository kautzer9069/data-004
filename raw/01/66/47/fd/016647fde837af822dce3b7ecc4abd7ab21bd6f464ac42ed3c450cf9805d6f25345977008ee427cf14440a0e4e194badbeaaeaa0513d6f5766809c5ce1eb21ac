So the Prime Source is not )'(anthropomorphic but as it spills forth into the field of time it becomes more recognizable, at least in a )'(mythological fashion.)'()'(Agape- Unconditional love.

The Gnostic views their self as a spirit, thus they are alien to the world.)'()'(Anthropos- "Man" \(neutral gender\). There are three levels to the Anthropos. One is the autogenes that is the )'(first principle of cognosance that is "the image of God". The next is the image of that image, or mind. The last )'(is the third image, which is the physical existence. In this way every person is a three fold being including the )'(Christ spirit, the soul, and the body.)'()'(Antinomianism- While this word literally refers to the belief that legal precepts are no longer applicable to a ")'(saved" individual, it has come to be used in regards to any libertine doctrines in common parlance concerning )'(Gnosticism.
